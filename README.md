# React + TypeScript + Vite

# PLEASE READ

I kept this demonstration as simple as possible but at the same time code readibility and performance is kept in mind. I dont do these basic css styling any more. I help juniors but mostly I do complex APIS integration, solving bugs and performance issues. Currently my focused is on backend side. I would love to work more on backend tasks ❤️
